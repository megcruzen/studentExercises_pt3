## Student Exercises Database

https://github.com/nashville-software-school/bangazon-inc/blob/master/book-1-orientation/chapters/STUDENT_EXERCISES_SQL.md

In this part of building your application, you will be creating the database tables and the data that you will be querying in your application logic later.

You will use `CREATE TABLE` statements and `INSERT` statements to create all the tables necessary for storing information about student exercises in a SQL Server database.

### Instructions
1. Create tables from each entity in the Student Exercises ERD.
1. Populate each table with data. You should have 2-3 cohorts, 5-10 students, 4-8 instructors, 2-5 exercises and each student should be assigned 1-2 exercises.
